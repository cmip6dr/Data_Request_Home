        <p>
	This version has just two changes, both intended for 01.00.17:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		cell_measures changed from areacella to areacellr for dgw, drivw, fclandToOcean, qgwr, rivi, rivo, wtd. These variables are, in some models, computed and reported on a different grid from the atmospheric variables. When a model uses the atmospheric grid for these variables, the areacellr data files should still be produced, with the same data content as the areacella files.</li>
	<li>
		areacellr: corrected desription: replacing reference to &quot;ice sheet model&quot; with &quot;river model&quot;.</li>
</ul>
