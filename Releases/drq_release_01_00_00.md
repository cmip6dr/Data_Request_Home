	First Publication Ready Release -- released December 21st.</p>
<p>
	This release includes updates to the requests from VIACSAB, AerChemMIP, LS3MIP, DCPP, and OMIP.</p>
<p>
	The documentation of the command line tool (<a href="http://proj.badc.rl.ac.uk/svn/exarch/CMIP6dreq/tags/latest/dreqPy/docs/dreqPy.pdf">dreqPy.pdf</a> ) has been updated and checked.</p>
<p>
	The focus has been on correcting the specifications for data requested from the DECK and CMIP6 historical experiments. The details for other experiments need to be updated.</p>
<p>
	There are still a significant number of CF Standard Names to be finalised, and there are likely to be some adjustments to variable long names and descriptions.</p>
<p>
	MIP tables names have been standardised (see &quot;<a href="https://www.earthsystemcog.org/projects/wip/mip_table_about">CMIP6 MIP tables</a>&quot;).</p>
